## Russian-language Ukrainian Keyboard Layout ##

Tired of staring at a Russian flag while your country is being invaded by the Russian army, but still need to type with the Russian character set? Then just copy the .keylayout and .icns file into /Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/ on your Mac! You probably need to reboot and then can choose the layout under System Preferences->Keyboard->Input Sources.

    sudo cp Ukrainian\ \(Russian\).keylayout /Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/
    sudo cp Ukrainian\ \(Russian\).icns /Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/


### Modify the layout ###

Feel the need to update the layout to your liking by adding in the Ukrainian language characters? Download the keyboard layout tool [Ukelele][0] and have at it.
